After looking at a D-link NAS that I borrowed from a friend I decided that i should buy a real NAS. 

I Finally settled on the Synology Diskstation DS214[![DS214](http://simon.ispy.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DS214.jpg)](http://simon.ispy.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DS214.jpg)


I'v gone through the checklist, migrating all unarranged photos (from 4 different iphoto-libraries, and my very old photos from pre 2008 ) into the NAS.
