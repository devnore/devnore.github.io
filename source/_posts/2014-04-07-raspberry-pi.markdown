A while ago I bought a Raspberry Pi (model B) planning to build an Entertainmentsystem. The main reason for this was that I had gotten tired on using My TVs builtin player that did not support any of the format I wanted to use.

After looking around on the alternatives I decided there where three ways to go.

1. Raspbmc
2. OpenELEC 
3. Build it myself.

As building it myself would take me to much time. I opted for either alternative 1 or 2. After looking at some vs writeups and youtube reviews it seamed to me that rasbmc was the faster of the two (less sluggish in menus and such).

Installing rasbmc was a breeze so I will not cover it, have a peek over at the official [www.raspbmc.com](http://www.raspbmc.com/).
