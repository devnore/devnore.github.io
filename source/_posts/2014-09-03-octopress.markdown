## Starting using octopress.

I'v decided to try using octopress in favor of wordpress. I'm hoping this will go better than my attempt to use [Ghost](https://ghost.org) .

One of the biggest best features of Wordpress is the Media Library. And without Wordpress backing this blog I have to figure out a good workflow for adding images to my blog. I'm thinking that using S3-style buckets tied in to our [Ceph](http://ceph.com) deployment at work. But this is not currently up and running so in the mean time i just have to use dropbox or add a custom rsync to octopress to push images as well as the blog.
